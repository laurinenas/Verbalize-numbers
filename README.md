# DoNumbers

Short piece of code that could use Data.Stream from upcomming elixir version for testing.
Basically it takes a number and returns a string with english name for the number.

Could be used for invoices where sums of money need to be expressed both in number and in text.
Intended as Ã©tude and explanation of what is new.
